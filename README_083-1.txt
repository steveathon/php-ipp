STATUS
    Currently, it is able to print on an IPP server, parses server's response,
    is able to cancel jobs, and do all REQUIRED and OPTIONAL operations from
    RFC2911.

    There is also a CUPS specific class, which performs CUPS specific
    operations.


LIMITATIONS
    - SSL/TLS works, but the integrated http backend is not capable of
      "upgrade".

DOCUMENTATION
    Complete documentation is in "./documentation", or in ./html,
    depending you use tarball or Debian package.

ORIGIN
    It is inspired by "PrintSendLPR", by Mick Sear, but there is no more code
    of it in. If you search for a very basic print client, uses it :)
    PrintSendLPR is available at http://www.phpclasses.org (license: LGPL).
    
TESTS
    Usage examples are given in "TEST_PrintIPP.php".

    You will find complete examples in ./examples or ./testfiles.
    
    Test _data_ files are distributed under GPL, but the aboves
    are under BSD License.

Enjoy !
