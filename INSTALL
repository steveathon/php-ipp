We use autogen/autoconf/automake, so type:

./autogen.sh && make install

This install assumes that your php.ini have
include_path = ".:/usr/local/share/php"
directive in your php.ini files

you may link /usr/local/etc/apache2/sites-available/phpprintipp
to etc/apache2/sites-available/phpprintipp

for a site-wide install:
./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr \
             --sysconfdir=/etc \
             --localstatedir=/var && make install


Usage:
require_once("printipp/CupsPrintIPP.php") // WITHOUT './' (search_path...)
// or ExtendedPrintIPP.php or PrintIPP.php, if you need less operations
Then see usage.html in documentation directory
