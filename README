HERE BE DRAGONS

This is a fork of the PHP IPP System that was built by Thomas Harding.

The last published version of the client was 0.83 which was published in
2010 and is now out of date. The purpose of this refresh is to take stock
of what has been done to date and, where possible, to update the codebase
with new features and settings.

Original readme is now at README_083-1.txt
